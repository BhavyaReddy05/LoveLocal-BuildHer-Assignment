**Easy 1 - Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.**
The Python code takes a string as input, splits it into words, and then prints the length of the last word. If there are no words in the string, it prints a message as Null.

**Medium 2 - Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.**
The Python code to find elements in an array that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times, where n is the length of the array. The algorithm is the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to find at most two candidates that may be the majority elements.
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array 'nums'. The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm uses a constant amount of space for variables regardless of the input size.

**Hard 2- You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.**
The Python code is an implementation of a function to find the shortest palindrome by adding characters in front of a given string.
The algorithm used in this code has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because, in the worst case, it may need to check each substring of the input string for palindromicity. The space complexity is O(1), as the additional space used is constant and does not depend on the input size.
